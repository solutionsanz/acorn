   - Ensure you have installed Vagrant on your laptop/PC. If you need help, [read this blog](https://redthunder.blog/2018/02/13/teaching-how-to-use-vagrant-to-simplify-building-local-dev-and-test-environments/). 

   - Download or Git clone this Github repo: 

			git clone https://github.com/solutionsanz/acorn

   - In a terminal window, go to where you cloned/downloaded the repository (acorn) â€“ Notice that the Vagrantfile is already in there.

    - Start up your Vagrant Dev VM:

	        vagrant up

   - A new Ubuntu VM will be provisioned and a bootstrap script will install all required utilities (e.g. docker).
    
            You can now **vagrant ssh** into it.

    - Go to your working directory (mounted from host OS).

            cd /vagrant

    - Use the setEnv_template to create your own environment properties file. As a minimum, make sure to set the MongoDB server, username and password.

            cp setEnv_template temp_setEnv && vi setEnv

    - Switch user to **ubuntu**

            sudo su ubuntu

    - Containerise the application by using the provided Dockerfile:

	        docker build .

    - Execute locally your new Docker Image of your Acorn Application:

	        docker run --env-file setEnv -p 3000:3000 -it [image_id] 

                Note, if you are unsure about the actual **image_id**, you can use **docker images** to gather all images being generated.

                Also note that by default port 3000 was configured in by vagrant as part of your VM setup.
